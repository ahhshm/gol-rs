This is my implementation of Conway's game of life to get my hands dirty with Rust.

Rules of the game:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
